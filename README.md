1. **Project Title:** Text-to-Speech Conversion for Indian Regional Languages

2. **Project Description:** This project is a web application that enables users to convert text from different regional languages in India into speech. It utilizes Amazon Polly API for speech synthesis, Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Indic Transliteration for script conversion, and langdetect for language detection.

3. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Set up AWS credentials: Create an AWS account, configure your credentials using AWS CLI or environment variables.
   
4. **Usage:**
   - Run the application: `python app.py`
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Choose an input option: URL or Text
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to input text or a URL and initiate the conversion.

5. **Configuration:**
   - AWS Credentials: Set up your AWS credentials to allow access to the Polly service.
   
6. **Dependencies:**
   - Flask: Web application framework.
   - boto3: AWS SDK for Python.
   - beautifulsoup4: HTML parsing and web scraping.
   - indic-transliteration: For script conversion.
   - langdetect: Language detection library.

7. **Code Structure:**
   - `app.py`: Main Flask application.
   - `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the web interface.
   - Functions for text conversion, AWS Polly integration, language detection, and web scraping.

8. **Web Interface:**
   - Home Page: Choose between URL and Text input options.
   - URL Input: Fetches text from a webpage and performs language-based conversion.
   - Text Input: Converts input text to speech after language detection.

9. **Examples:**
   - **URL Input Example:**
     1. Enter a URL of a webpage in the input field.
     2. The text is fetched and language is detected.
     3. Text is converted to Devanagari script if required and sent to AWS Polly for speech synthesis.
     4. Audio output is generated and made available for download.

   - **Text Input Example:**
     1. Enter text in the input field.
     2. Language is detected.
     3. Text is converted to Devanagari script if required and sent to AWS Polly for speech synthesis.
     4. Audio output is generated and made available for download.

10. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If AWS Polly integration fails, ensure your AWS credentials are correctly configured.
   - For web scraping, ensure the provided URL is valid and accessible.
   - If language detection is incorrect, provide the correct language using the language selector.
